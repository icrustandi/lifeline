  <h1>About lifeline</h1>
</div>

<div>
     <p>Our theme at Lifeline Church is that "life matters." We are a
community of Christ followers who are partnering with an Indonesian
Church in Southern California who wholeheartedly believe that Jesus
came to bring life and that there is no better way to experience life
to the fullest than following Him in everything we do.</p>
<p>
     Lifeline is led by Steve Campodonico. Steve and his family have
served overseas as missionaries for over a decade and have also served
in churches in the US in different capacities.</p>

   <p>  As you come to Lifeline you will find a close knit group of
people who are excited about what God is doing in their lives. We
don't have all the answers, but are striving to be a community of
faith, hope, and love impacting the community around us as well as our
global community. </p>
<p>
     We welcome people from all walks of life, regardless of where
they are in their spiritual journey. We'd love to invite you to check
out one of our services or activities and see what God is doing in our
midst. As one of our members has said, "because you've got nothing to
lose and everything to gain."</p>
