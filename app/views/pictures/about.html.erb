      Our theme at Lifeline Church is that "life matters." We are a community of Christ followers who are partnering with an Indonesian Church in Southern California who wholeheartedly believe that Jesus came to bring life and that there is no better way to experience life to the fullest than following Him in everything we do.

       Lifeline is led by Steve Campodonico. Steve and his family have served overseas as missionaries for over a decade and have also served in churches in the US in different capacities.

       As you come to Lifeline you will find a close knit group of people who are excited about what God is doing in their lives. We don't have all the answers, but are striving to be a community of faith, hope, and love impacting the community around us as well as our global community.

       We welcome people from all walks of life, regardless of where they are in their spiritual journey. We'd love to invite you to check out one of our services or activities and see what God is doing in our midst. As one of our members has said, "because you've got nothing to lose and everything to gain."
